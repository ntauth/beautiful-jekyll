# Godyn - The Introspection Library
`Godyn` is a Windows-only library written in Golang and assembly that makes auditing, dissecting and changing Windows structures
easier and quicker. 

# Why Godyn?
I personally started the project as a pastime challenge for me to learn Go and apply this knowledge on an interesting project. So I figured, why not port an existing **C++** (my PEParser) library to **Go** and then extend it? 
However, it turned out the library shares several of the objectives of Go's [golang.org/x/sys/windows](golang.org/x/sys/windows) package
for Windows low-level interop and, as such, might seem superfluous. The truth is that `Godyn` embraces a diametrically opposed philosopy: 
`Godyn` only does few select things, but aims to do them properly. You can view `Godyn` as a swiss-knife for the introspection of Windows structures.

Therefore, this is by no means a copy of `golang.org/x/sys/windows` (besides, I didn't even know it existed before writing this post) and is definitely not as complete.

# Features
- Runtime dynamic link library symbol resolution (`GetProcAddress`).
- Tools for thread and process internal information (`TEB` and `PEB`) auditing.
- PE header parser.
- Hooking primitives (`SetWindowsHookEx`) and low-level IPC (`WriteProcessMemory` et al). This is still **WIP**.
