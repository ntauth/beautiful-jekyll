subtitle: Who am I?
---

My name is Ayoub Chouak. I'm currently pursuing a BSc in Computer Science at the **University of Milano-Bicocca** (DISCO).
Computers have always been compelling to me, and I hardly imagine myself being what I now am had it not been for them.

My research is mainly focused on information security, exploitation techniques and operating system internals. I've recently
started studying artificial intelligence, in an attempt to see what the recent buzz is all about.

Where do I see myself in five years? Hopefully, doing cutting-edge research of state-of-the-art problems and technologies in 
Computer Science in a world-class research group. I may sound a little bit too ambitious, but dreaming has never hurt anyone, has it?
