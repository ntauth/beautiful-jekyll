subtitle: Nothing really special. Just a genuine rooted passion for anything that coffee can turn into code.

My name is Ayoub Chouak. I'm currently pursuing a BSc in Computer Science at the University of Milan-Bicocca (DISCO).
Computers have always been compelling to me, and I hardly imagine myself being what I now am had it not been for them.

### My Accomplishments

- Invited for a complimentary pass to **Black Hat USA 2017** (Mandalay Bay - Las Vegas).
- I make good coffee.
